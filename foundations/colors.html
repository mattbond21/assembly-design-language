<p>The color palette is a cornerstone of Quizlet, giving the product an immediate sense of being familiar and warm. The color palette leverages Quizlet’s brand heritage, and builds on its sense of energy, intelligence, and confidence. It adds warmth and a human touch.</p>

<p>Quizlet is committed to complying with AA standard contrast ratios for all text that is not “incidental”. The color combinations in this guide don’t comply with the AA standard just yet. Make sure you don’t rely on color alone to convey state or meaning.</p>
