<h4>Native</h4>
<p>Assembly components support responsive scaling to support different native screen sizes. Even though components can automatically adapt, it’s still best practice to check your designs on various device sizes. When recommending a new component ensure it is designed in Phone and Tablet sizes.</p>

<h4>Web</h4>
<p>On web, components are placed in a responsive grid that has several breakpoints that account for viewing Quizlet on phone, tablet, and desktop.</p>

<h3>Units and scaling</h3>
<h4>Native</h4>
<p>On mobile, screen pixel density may vary between devices, so it’s preferable to use points for sizing. Points are translated into real pixels depending on the device density. We always design in 1x, where one 1pt equals 1px, and we scale up the design for different devices.</p>

<h4>Web</h4>
<p>While some monitors can have different pixel densities, we continue using pixels for spacing and measurements. Our pixel units will be transformed to rems in production code.</p>
