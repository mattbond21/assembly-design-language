<h3>What is Assembly?</h3>
<p>Assembly is a collection of components defined by shared principles and patterns. Assembly allows for quick iteration using a shared vocabulary across design, engineering, and other disciplines. The design team tries to solve challenging interactions at the beginning, and then apply the solutions consistently across Quizlet&mdash;making sure people only have to learn our product once.</p>
