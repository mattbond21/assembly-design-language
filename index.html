<h1>Assembly Design Language</h1>
<h2 class=sub-head>At Quizlet, we want to design empowering experiences for our users. We&rsquo;ve implemented an evolving resource for creating harmonious, simple experiences.</h2>

<span class="heading-border"></span>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Assembly is a collection of components defined by shared principles and patterns. Assembly allows for quick iteration using a shared vocabulary across design, engineering, and other disciplines. The design team tries to solve challenging interactions at the beginning, and then apply the solutions consistently across Quizlet&mdash;making sure people only have to learn our product once.</p>

<!-- <h2>Where can I give feedback, make requests, or ask a question?</h2>
<p>There is a <a href="https://app.asana.com/0/470916106130991/470916106130991" target="_blank">Design System Inbox</a> project set up or you can jump into our #living-styleguide Slack channel.</p> -->

<!-- <h1>Principles</h1>
<p>Things in here. These are the core principles that we use to design at Quizlet. Together, they compose the purest vision of the system.</p>

<h2>Allow users to focus without interference</h2>
<p>A user&rsquo;s focus should be in their control, only distract users with changes that are personally relevant.</p>

<h2>Increase confidence through clarity</h2>
<p>Within the application, and more broadly within teams, it is unambiguous what is happening and why.</p>

<h2>Foster productive and emotionally satisfying interpersonal dynamics</h2>
<p>Users feel like they are part of a team, where they can count on each other to do their part, and feel like they&rsquo;re moving forward towards a common goal.</p>

<h2>Design for fast, effortless, and intentional interactions</h2>
<p>Simple and common tasks should be frictionless and obvious; complex tasks should feel efficient and delightful. But, speed should not lead to inaccuracies.</p>

<h2>Empower everyone through progressive discoverability</h2>
<p>Everyone at all levels of experience with Quizlet should feel like they know how to use the product, regardless of how many features they use.</p> -->
